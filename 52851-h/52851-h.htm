yesterday.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Yesterday? Oh! Oh! oh! (<i>Strolls off</i> <small>R</small>. <i>to

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>grimly</i>). Where did <i>you</i> sleep?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Where did I sleep?</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. I’m <i>asking</i> you.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. What a funny question to ask anyone! I slept at home—in there—of
course .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. obviously .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. naturally.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Whenever you adopt that innocent attitude I always know you are
telling me a wilful lie.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I couldn’t tell you a lie if I tried. Do you remember that
phrenologist we went to at Eastbourne? He told me I had an enormous bump of veracity.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. This is nothing to do with phrenology. Am I to believe that you
slept at home last night?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>guiltily</i>). Y—yes, of course. Why?</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. I slept at home, too. Strange we didn’t meet.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Yes, that <i>is</i> funny.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. I locked that bedroom door from half-past eleven last night
until nine o’clock this morning.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Well, if you lock the bedroom door, how can you possibly expect me
to sleep at home? Absurd! (<i>Getting into jacket.</i>) No, I’ll tell you the whole facts
of the case, Pam. We went to the—er—opera last night.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. We?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Yes. My friend Tully and I. Tully had some tickets given him.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. And you came home together?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Y-yes. And—er—I slept at Tully’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. What opera did you go to?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>broad gestures</i>). The—a—a—the—a—that’s rather a silly
question. No one ever goes to an opera and remembers anything about the performance.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. But the name of the opera?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Oh!—o-h! The name! (<i>With assumed confidence.</i>) You mean what
the opera was called?</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Exactly.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. The—er—the title?</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Yes.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Well—er—you know the—the opera where the girl comes on with a
sewing machine—no, you know what I mean—a spinning wheel; two long
plaits—Marguerite—Faust, that’s it!</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Faust?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Yes, Faust—with the devil in it.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(<i>Business of putting fingers to forehead.</i>)</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. And so you both went to see Faust?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. After that we came home. (<i>Crosses to</i> <small>L</small>.
<i>laughing</i>). I remember making a joke to Tully——</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Never mind the joke.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Well, it was just then that I missed my latchkey.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. You missed your latchkey?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. And it was rather late to rouse Chalmers, so Tully offered me a
shakedown at his place, and I stayed there.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. There’s a good deal of <i>Tully</i> about it. But if you lost
your latch-key, how did you get in just now?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>smiling</i>). Oh, I found the key afterwards.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Well, give it to me.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(J<small>OHN</small> <i>hesitates.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent">Give it to me, please. (J<small>OHN</small> <i>obeys. She goes up to

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Oh, don’t say that. It isn’t cricket, Pam, to throw the rent up in
my face. After all, it was you who made me give up my office in the city.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. For the simple reason you were making——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I was making a profit of five pounds a week!</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. And it was costing me another fifteen pounds to keep the office
open. (<i>Coming down to</i> J<small>OHN</small>.) Now look here. I have enough for both,
so long as you do not work in the City.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Well, I can’t grub along on five pounds a week like some
people.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Must I remind you that I have been allowing you forty pounds a
month?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. No, excuse me, dear; it was agreed between us that my allowance
should be fifteen pounds only.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(<i>Telegraph knock and ring off</i> <small>L</small>.)</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. I’m quite aware it was agreed. But you keep borrowing on

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>faintly</i>). As much as that?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>coming down</i> <small>R</small>.). You did your share very
well.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. What’s going to happen now?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. She’ll probably pack up and go home to her mother’s.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>rising and crossing to</i> J<small>OHN</small>). John, where
<i>did</i> you go last night?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I took a little friend out to dinner and then we went on to the
Palace, and after that we had supper at the Five Hundred Club. We watched them dancing and
had a dance or two ourselves, but it’s perfectly absurd if a man can’t have a little
innocent enjoyment and a couple of dances with a little bit of fluff without all this
absurd fuss.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. But the hour?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. At the Club we kept it up a bit late, that’s all. We had breakfast
at Jimmy Dawson’s flat and cooked bacon and eggs.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Won’t you promise never to do such a thing again?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>crossing to</i> <small>L</small>.). I’ll promise never to poach
an egg in an opera hat again. I can’t possibly live without some relaxation now and
then.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. But must you really go out and about with little bits of
flu—flu—fluff?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Most certainly if I want to. What have you got to say to that?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Oh, dear, dear, dear!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Everything would have been all right only you were so infernally
stupid about the opera. I’m sure “Marguerite and plaits” was perfectly clear. If you had
only said “Faust” without any hesitation everything would have been all right.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. But it’s so risky. They play a different opera every night at
Covent Garden.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I know they do. I wonder what they <i>did</i> <span

newspaper? (<i>Looking round for paper—seeing paper on table</i> <small>R</small>.

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>crossing to</i> P<small>AMELA</small>). One moment, Mrs.
Ayers. You know I feel somehow that I am to blame for all this. I don’t want to pose as a
hyper-religious man, but every one says I’m very good, and I wouldn’t deceive you for the
world. I’m sure that necklace was intended for you.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>opening suitcase</i>). Well, in any case, I value my feelings
at something more than a—a—a one-and-elevenpenny pearl necklace. (<i>Drops necklace into
case and shuts it.</i>)</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Really I think you are doing John an injustice. I don’t think you
quite understand his little ways.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. I understand as much as is fit for me to understand.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. No, really, I know John doesn’t behave in a conventional manner
as a rule, but he is quite harmless.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>raging—up to</i> T<small>ULLY</small>—<i>then crossing

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. “John stayed here, Kew.” (<i>Reading.</i>) “John stayed here,
Bloomsbury.” “John stayed, Barnes.” Kensington—Bloomsbury to Kew—Kew to
Kensington—Kensington to Barnes. It couldn’t be done in the time! Oh, I can quite
understand this. It’s all John’s friends—all anxious to shield him from the fury of his
wife.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>angrily</i>). I beg your pardon!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I mean all anxious to shield him from your displeasure. John has
such a host of good friends. There isn’t one who wouldn’t lay down his life for him. Why,
John’s one of the best in the world.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>crossing to</i> <small>L</small>. <i>by table down</i>

angels. But there’s a limit to everything.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>crossing to</i> P<small>AMELA</small>). I quite agree with you
in that, Mrs. Ayers, but as a broad-minded woman you must see that a man like John wants a
little relaxation, and there’s really no harm if he does go out to dinner occasionally
with—what was it he called them?—little pieces—no, little bits of fluff.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>madly</i>). What? What??? (T<small>ULLY</small>
<i>recoils</i>—P<small>AMELA</small> <i>follows him up to</i> <small>C</small>.). You

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>crosses to</i> T<small>ULLY</small>). That’s all through your
meddling in things that don’t concern you.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Did you really sleep in six different beds?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Oh, don’t be silly.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Is there any chance of her returning?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Of course she’ll come back! She does this sort of thing about
every fortnight.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Do you sleep out as often as that?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. No! She does it with the idea that I shall go and fetch her
back.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Well, why don’t you?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Because once I do that my authority will be gone. She’ll treat me
like a child, and leave home two or three times a day. Things have never gone so badly as
this before.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>suddenly aroused</i>). Hah, the necklace! Where is it? Where is

it. (<i>Both look about for the necklace.</i>) Ah, it may be under the table. (<i>They
both dive under the table from opposite ends—their heads collide—they both come up holding
their heads in pain.</i>) Can’t you see where you are going?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I can only see stars.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Your head’s like iron. But where’s the necklace? (<i>Moving
arm-chair from right of table</i> <small>R</small>.<small>C</small>. <i>to below table

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I’ve got it!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Where?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. No—not the necklace—I’ve got an idea.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Oh——</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I expect Mrs. Ayers took it. You practically gave it to her,
didn’t you?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>aghast</i>). You think she took it?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Yes, I remember now—while I was talking to her just now I saw her

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. It doesn’t matter—you can get it back from her.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>still looking about for necklace</i>). She’ll never part with
it—she loves jewellery.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Well, you can easily buy another. (<i>Putting hand in
pocket.</i>) I’ll lend you the one-and-elevenpence.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. One-and-elevenpence! One-and-elevenpence! Do you know <i>that
necklace is worth five hundred</i> pounds!!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Five hundred pounds!!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Yes. It was lent to little Mamie Scott by the Rajah of Changpoor.
She took a fancy to the necklace, and he lent it to her to wear just for the evening.
There was a big crush as we came out of the club last night, and Mamie asked me to put the
necklace in my pocket for safety’s sake, as the clasp was broken, which I did, of course.
Apparently we both forgot all about it. She’ll be in an awful stew. She promised
faithfully to return the necklace to the Rajah to-day.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Oh, dear, dear, dear!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Oh, damn, damn, damn! What can I do? What can I say? What will
Mamie think of me.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>stops footling</i>). Is there no way of getting it back from

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I tell you she’ll never part with it, and she may not be home for
several days, possibly a week. In the meantime the Rajah will be clamouring for his pearls
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I shall be branded as a—well, there’s no telling what it may lead to.

another.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Didn’t you hear me say that necklace cost five hundred pounds?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>crossing, sits down</i> <small>L</small>.). Don’t be a

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. It’s easy enough. I had a letter from someone only this morning,
offering to lend me any sum from £10 to £10,000, without any security. He enclosed his
photograph. Such a nice, kind, honest open face.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. You innocent lamb! Well, I suppose if I can’t give it back I shall
have to find the money.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. You will? Oh, it is a fix! (<i>Biting his nails.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>rises, goes up to</i> T<small>ULLY</small>). I say, Tully, I
suppose you don’t happen to have five hundred that you don’t want.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Not that I don’t want.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Poor old Tully! You never seem to have any money. I don’t know
what you live on. Are you sure you get enough to eat?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. You know, John, if I had the money I couldn’t refuse you. You do
know that, don’t you, John?</p>

could.</p>

Turner get five hundred, and I get nothing?</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small> (<i>laughing</i>). We did. (<i>Both laugh amusedly, thinking it a

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I left it in my coat, and I left the coat at the club.</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small> (<i>rising—alarmed</i>). Jack. It isn’t lost?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>pressing her gently into chair</i>). Sit down. Sit down and

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. Five—hundred—pounds!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Yes. I can’t forget that! But it’s a mere flea-bite to me.</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. Jack, you don’t understand, the Rajah looks on it as an
heirloom—he wouldn’t part with it for the world—that’s why I wanted to wear it—it was such
a cute idea. But I promised faithfully to return it to the Rajah to-day.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Can’t you make some excuse?</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. How can I? Have you been to the Club?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. No, I can’t possibly go down there for a day or two—for a
particular reason.</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. Oh, I <i>do</i> hope it isn’t lost. Can’t you ’phone?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Oh, yes. I <i>did</i> ’phone, but the club ’phone seems to be out

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. That’s torn it! What <i>will</i> the Rajah think of me!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Now don’t worry. If you’ll only wait everything will be all right.
In any case if it is lost, I’ll buy you another exactly like it. I can’t say more, can
I?</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. You really mean that?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I’m expecting a man here presently to examine me.</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. To examine you?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Yes, I’m very ill, you know—I was in a ’bus accident the other
day, and—er—things have been getting worse.</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. Poor old Jack! I <i>am</i> sorry. (<i>Pulling his face to her
with hand under his chin.</i>) But you don’t look ill.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>turning face again to front</i>). No, I’m one of those who bear
up to the last! Now, listen, when this man calls I want you to pretend that I’m bad. Of
course I <i>am</i> bad, but while he’s here I am sure to be a little worse. Mrs.
Ayers—that is me—has been speaking to him on the ’phone and naturally when he comes he’ll
expect to see me—that is—Mrs. Ayers—I—I see, you don’t understand.</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small> (<i>very sympathetically</i>). Jack, dear, you haven’t injured
your head, have you?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. No, it’s quite all right. Nothing to do, but—er—don’t say you’re
my wife. Just pat me on the head now and then and moan “Poor John”—you understand?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. Yes, I understand. “Poor John.” But say, this is spoof, you’re

Tuesdays and Fridays. (<i>Again down to her and seeing leg, stumbles backwards and wiping

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. Chest measurement?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Forty-two, too.</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. Ever been vaccinated?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Oh no, he never catches anything!</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small> (<i>writing again</i>). Now, Mr. Ayers, you say you were
travelling in one of the company’s ’buses when this accident took place.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Of course I was—last Friday—coming from Kew. Oh!
(<i>Groans.</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. Poor John!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Poor John!</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small> (<i>resuming</i>). Could you tell me who was inside the ’bus,
or describe the people in any way?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. There was a Mr. Richard Turner——</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small> (<i>breaking in</i>). Yes, we have acknowledged <i>his</i>

oh, I <i>am</i> bad!</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. Could you describe anyone else who was in the ’bus?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. There were two soldiers in khaki and a <i>very fat old
woman.</i></p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. Did these people make any statement or pass any remark?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. When the collision occurred some one said it was like being out at
the front.</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. The stout lady said that.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(M<small>AMIE</small> <i>turns away smiling.</i>
T<small>ULLY</small> <i>shows surprise and disgust.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. No, Mr. Trippett. The soldier!</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. Poor John!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>who is now on left of</i> T<small>RIPPETT</small>—<i>pats</i>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small> (<i>turns on</i> T<small>ULLY</small> <i>very annoyed, then
back to</i> J<small>OHN</small>). Now may I ask—why didn’t you report this at the
time?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. How could I? I was too stunned, I suppose.</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. I quite appreciate what you say, Mr. Ayers, but it’s one of
our rules that you should have lodged your complaint at the time the accident
occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I suppose if a man was killed stone dead, he ought to leave his
name and address.</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. If he knew where he was going. But in this case the situation
is rather difficult. The Mr. Turner you mentioned just now informed us that he was the
only passenger injured in the accident and the other occupants of the ’bus rather bear out
his statement.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. How does he know? He couldn’t see my back!</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. You see, you have no witnesses. (<i>Shrugs.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. No witnesses indeed! Oh yes, I have. Don’t you run away with any
idea like that. My friend Tully here was sitting next to me in the ’bus the whole of the
time!</p>

<p class="direction_c">(T<small>ULLY</small> <i>almost collapses.</i>)</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. Oh, indeed—indeed!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>quickly and very agitated—down to</i> <small>L</small>.
<i>of</i> T<small>RIPPETT</small>). But I make no claim! Indeed I don’t. No. I make no
claim! I make no claim at all!</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. I don’t think I have your name and address?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Mr. Bertram Josiah Tully. (<i>Very important.</i>) Number 14
Saint Mark’s Mansions.</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small> (<i>writing—then to</i> T<small>ULLY</small>). And you yourself
were not injured?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Not at present—I mean, not a scratch!</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. Poor John!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Poor John!</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small> (<i>looks at</i> J<small>OHN</small>). How do you account for
that, if he was sitting next to you, Mr. Ayers?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. When the collision came I fell forward on the two soldiers—they
had been in training for months and were as hard as nails, and naturally I sprained my
back, while Mr. Tully here shot forward right on top of <i>the fat old woman!</i></p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. And not hurt?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. She was <i>enormously fat!</i></p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small> (<i>to</i> T<small>ULLY</small>, <i>who is now up again behind
arm-chair</i>). <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-37">[Pg

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. No, but the woman did!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I think I said, “Oh, dear, dear, (<i>pause</i>) dear!”</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Of course I shall have to take proceedings against your company if
it costs me every penny my wife’s got. I mean, that I’ve got!</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. I don’t think that will be necessary, Mr. Ayers, our company
is a very generous one, and although we cannot acknowledge any legal obligation we like to
treat our passengers as fairly as we can——</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I’m sure you do.</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. We like to make friends——</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. You have a friendly face, Mr. Trippett.</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. We want to see you riding in our ’buses again.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Mind you, I like your ’buses.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. They’re such a pretty colour.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(M<small>AMIE</small> <i>digs</i> T<small>ULLY</small> <i>in

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. And if this matter could be settled at once, I’m sure you
would be most satisfied.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I’m sure I should.</p>

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. Now speaking without prejudice, what sum of money do you fancy
would compensate you?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>to</i> M<small>AMIE</small>). What do you think, dear?</p>

<p class="direction_c">(T<small>ULLY</small> <i>signalling five hundred on

<p class="noindent">You see, there’ll be all the doctor’s expenses, a terrible loss of

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small> (<i>raises his eyebrows</i>). I’m afraid that’s quite out of
the question. Do you realize what five hundred means? I’m afraid we couldn’t entertain
anything like that. But I’ll tell you what I <i>will</i> do. If you like to settle the
matter off-hand now and give <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-38">[Pg

away for a nice little holiday on a five-pun’ note.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>rises, anger rising</i>). Really I think you’ve come here to

<p>T<small>RIPPETT</small>. Certainly not, Mr. Ayers—and without prejudice I think you
would be well advised to accept my offer.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>up to</i> T<small>RIPPETT</small>). And without prejudice I

I’ve been spending it on you.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Now, Mrs. Ayers, didn’t we stipulate that there were to be no
two’s? (<i>To</i> J<small>OHN</small>.) At two-handed nap you can’t call less than three
surely.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(<i>They both argue loudly.</i>)</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>looking round</i>). Now don’t quarrel, there’s good
children.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Tully’s a bad loser.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I’m not. You’re a bad player. How can we possibly call two’s—it’s
no game at all.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Well, I go—<i>three!</i></p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Very good, I pass three.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(<i>They play the hand.</i> P<small>AMELA</small> <i>strolls down,
putting on gloves, and watches game.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Play to that. I’ll give you “two’s.” That’s one. (<i>Plays
again.</i>)</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Trump! Aha!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I’m not afraid of that.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. You won’t get this. (<i>Plays card.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Thank you. (<i>Leads again.</i>)</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>takes the trick</i>). That’s another one up against you.
(<i>Leads again.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>takes the trick</i>). Got it! Got it! Got it!</p>

<p class="direction_c">(P<small>AMELA</small> <i>comes down to top of table.</i>)</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Nothing could touch a hand like that.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>teasing</i> T<small>ULLY</small>). You <i>get</i> the cards,
Tully, but you don’t know how to <i>play</i> them.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Oh, I think Mr. Tully plays a very excellent game.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(<i>They start dealing.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent">Now just a moment.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Where are you going?</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. I just want to run round and see how mother is. I’ll leave John
in your care, Mr. Tully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Certainly, Mrs. Ayers.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>to</i> T<small>ULLY</small>). Would you mind answering the
door?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Answering the door? Of course he will. What’s he here for?</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. We sent the maids away a week ago, they talk so.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Cook said she knew positively there was nothing the matter with me
at all.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. So I’ve given them a holiday.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Much the wisest thing to do.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>to</i> T<small>ULLY</small>). If the inspector or the doctor
from the ’bus company calls, just ask him in and say I shall not be long. And you,
John——</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Oh, I shall get into bed like a flash of lightning.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. I don’t suppose they’ll come.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>looking at</i> P<small>AMELA</small>). Do you think it’s wise
to wear that necklace on these dark nights. You might have it stolen.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>smiling and displaying necklace</i>). Ah! I’ve been waiting
for you to notice it.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Well, it’s running a risk. I should leave it at home if I were
you.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Does it look valuable to <i>you?</i></p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Of course it does.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Well, it isn’t—this is only imitation.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Oh, it looks just the same to me.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Mother had the real one copied for thirty shillings, she was so
afraid I should lose it.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. That’s very thoughtful.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Mother <i>does</i> know.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>posing</i>). But it <i>looks</i> genuine, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. It looks jolly good. (<i>Artfully.</i>) What have you done with
the <i>real</i> one?</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Ah! that’s telling! I’m never going to part with that as long as
I live. (<i>Crossing to door</i> <small>L</small>.). Shall I give your love to mother?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. No!</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. John!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I mean yes.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(<i>Exit</i> P<small>AMELA</small>.)</p>

<p class="noindent">Yes, if you like. (<i>To</i> T<small>ULLY</small>.) That’s the
fourteenth love I’ve sent to mother this week.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(<i>Door slams off</i> <small>L</small>.)</p>

<p class="direction_c">(T<small>ULLY</small> <i>shuffles cards.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent">I don’t mind telling you, Tully, I’m more than sick of this business.
I’ve been shut up now for nearly a fortnight.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. But the doctor from the ’bus company ought to have called on you
long ago.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. He did call—last Friday week, and I happened to be out. Just my
luck. Pam saw him and made some excuse, and he said he’d call again. But he hasn’t been
near the place since.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(T<small>ULLY</small> <i>deals the cards for nap.</i>)</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Their idea is of course to tire you out.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. And we’ve <i>got</i> to be careful. Did you read about Dick
Turner?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. He got his five hundred pounds out of them, didn’t he?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Yes. But do you know the latest? They’re going to have him up for
fraud.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Oh, dear! dear! dear! What does <i>Mrs.</i> Ayers say about
it?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. The Turner case has rather upset her. She’s terribly afraid of the
law. If you mention the word she has a panic.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. So you see, good people are the happiest after all.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. But they don’t always look it. (<i>Looks at</i>
T<small>ULLY</small> <i>with a grin.</i>) Let me see now, it’s my call, isn’t it?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. No, John, you called last time.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. So I did. You’re quite right.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>jubilant</i>). I’m going nap!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. You’re—going—nap?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Yes!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>rising</i>). Hark! It’s the doctor—the doctor from the ’bus
company. (<i>Flings off blanket and rushes to door</i> <small>R</small>., <i>groaning as
if in pain.</i>)</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>runs to window</i>). There’s nobody there. Desist! (<i>Comes
down to door</i> <small>L</small>.) Desist!</p>

<p class="direction_c">(J<small>OHN</small> <i>stops groaning.</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent">There’s nobody at the door—not a sign of anyone.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Really, are you sure? (<i>Coming to table</i>
<small>C</small>.)</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Quite sure.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>mixing cards up all together</i>). All right! Deal again. Deal
again. (<i>Sits.</i>)</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>comes to table—looks with disgust at cards, gathers them up
and sits</i>). It’s a very funny thing, John, but every time I call nap you imagine you
hear the doctor coming. Coincidence, I suppose. (<i>Gives a big sigh.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. What’s the matter with you, Tully? Have you ever been in love?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>looks and smiles</i>). I was nearly caught once.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Oh, what was her name?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Agnes. (<i>Sorrowfully.</i>) She made a vow that if she ever met
a really good man she would love him though he be as ugly as sin.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. And she loved you?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Devotedly.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Why didn’t you marry the girl?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. She was so expensive.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. They all are. I don’t believe woman <i>was</i> the rib of man I
believe she was the expendix—I mean the appendix—no use to anybody.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. That’s what makes me so timid. I’m so afraid that one of these
days some woman will get me into a corner and make me do something thoughtless. (<i>Cards
dealt.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I shouldn’t worry about that if I were you. Let me see, it’s my
call, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Yes.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Well, I pass!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. You pass? Well—I—I—you can’t hear the doctor coming, can you?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. N—o.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Well, I’m going—nap!!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. What again?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. You haven’t given me a chance yet!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>rises</i>). I have an idea.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. No, no, play this hand first; I’ve called nap.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>searches on table</i> <small>L</small>.<small>C</small>.). No,
it’s not there.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. What are you looking for?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. The—real necklace!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. She wouldn’t leave it about like that.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. You don’t know—she might.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(<i>Postman’s double knock heard off</i> <small>L</small>.)</p>

<p class="noindent">(<i>Rushing for bedroom door.</i>) The doctor! The doctor! (<i>The
blanket is left in arm-chair.</i>)</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. It isn’t—it isn’t the doctor. It’s the postman. It’s the postman.
I know his knock.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(J<small>OHN</small> <i>goes out of door</i> <small>L</small>.,
<i>returns with a letter and reads it</i> <small>C</small>.)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>speaking off</i>). Yes! You’re right. There’s a letter in the
box. (<i>Enters.</i>)</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I told you it was only the postman. <i>Do</i> come and play this
nap out. I’ve got such beautiful cards!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Hang your nap—this is serious. It’s from little Mamie Scott.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Mamie Scott? Who’s she?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. You know—your wife!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Oh, don’t start that again, <i>please!</i> (<i>Rises.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>reading from letter</i>). “The Rajah declines to wait any
longer for his necklace and threatens to place the matter in the hands of the police.”</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Oh, dear! dear! dear!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. You’d better go and tell her the necklace is <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-48">[Pg 48]</a></span>having its clasp
repaired and is coming back from the jeweller’s to-morrow.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Is it?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Oh, do have a little common sense. I think I know where to find
her. Put on your hat and go round to the Five Hundred Club.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Is that a ladies’ club?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. No—er—mixed.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. No, I couldn’t do that—really.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Why not?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I never believed in mixed schools or mixed bathing, and I’m
certainly not going to a mixed club at my time of life.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. All you’ve got to do is to ask for Miss Mamie Scott.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. No, no. I’ve never been to such a place as the Five Hundred Club
in my life.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Take your Cheque Book with you. They’ll make you very welcome.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. A great deal too welcome, I expect. No, I couldn’t do it. Why
don’t <i>you go?</i></p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. How can I? I’m ill in bed. It’s a hundred to one if I put my foot
on the doorstep I should run into the arms of the doctor, Pamela and the whole ’bus
company. Ruin, divorce and fraud await me on the doorstep.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Well, I’m not going.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Don’t forget you’re in this as well as me; if that necklace is
lost you’re a party to it.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Oh, don’t say that.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. You’ve acknowledged that little woman as your wife. She’s not the
sort to be played with.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Oh, don’t talk like that.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. But I do talk like that.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Here—take my key—step over the balcony—(<i>pointing to window</i>
<small>L</small>.<small>C</small>.)—get through my window and go out through my flat and
come back the same way.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Along the balcony and through your flat! They wouldn’t see me
then. I could do it in twenty minutes in a taxi, couldn’t I?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Easily!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Top-hole—that’s splendid!</p>

<p class="direction_c">(<i>Exit door</i> <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. There isn’t a soul at home—the maid’s out. (<i>At

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>spoken off</i>). What say?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. You’ll play this nap out when you come <i>back?</i></p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>spoken off</i>). Oh yes!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I’ll leave the cards just as they are.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>spoken off</i>). Right-o!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I won’t look at your hand.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>off</i>). All right!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Do you know this is the fourth nap I’ve been done out of?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>off</i>). Bad luck!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. How long will you be?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>off</i>). About twenty minutes, I should say.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Somehow I don’t quite like being left here alone.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>off</i>). Why not?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I have a presentiment of impending disaster.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>off</i>). Say it again!</p>

ever had in my life. I shall never be the same man again.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>ties up tube with handkerchief</i>). There, that’ll hold, I
think. Now, I’ll go and cover your retreat. (<i>Crosses to</i> <small>R</small>.)</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>picking up telegram from table</i>
<small>L</small>.<small>C</small>.). Oh! Here’s a telegram! Telegrams always make me feel
so nervous! (<i>Opens it and reads.</i>) It’s from Aunt Hannah, she’s coming up to-day.
I’ve been expecting her for the last three weeks. I am the only relation she has, and in
order to avoid the death-duties she’s going to make a Deed of Gift to me amounting to
several thousand pounds!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Several thousand pounds! Now that <i>is</i> mean. Look at the
trouble you’ve put me to. You might have lent me the money and so saved me a fortnight’s
illness.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>rises</i>). Will you accept the £500 from me?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I suppose I must.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. That <i>is</i> good of you!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Not at all! You have such a winning way with you. One can’t help
doing as you wish.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>smiles broadly</i>). That’s taken a great load off my mind.
The old lady is very generous. Directly she arrives we must both be very nice to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Trust me for that. And I <i>can</i> be nice when I like.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I know you can. But what about the ’Bus Company?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Oh yes. I’ll get you to go back and say I withdraw my claim.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Yes. I’d love to do that. (<i>Picking up letter from table</i>
<small>L</small>.<small>C</small>.)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I’ll buy Mamie a new necklace, and tell Pam the whole truth—that
Mamie is not your wife, but your little bit of fluff named Agnes.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. No, I draw the line there, Mamie’s <i>your</i> fluff. <i>You</i>
must shoulder that responsibility.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. But you’re a single man. It doesn’t matter about you.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Oh yes it does. I’ve got to think of my reputation down at the
Mission.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Oh, hang your mission!</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Oh, dear! (<i>Becomes very serious as he reads letter.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. What’s up?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. It’s a letter from the Motor ’Bus Company.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Motor ’Bus Company?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. They’re going to sue <i>me.</i></p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Sue <i>you</i>, what for?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. The fat woman who had three ribs broken says that I am
liable—that my fall on her was premeditated and nothing to do with the accident. Oh, and
listen to this. (<i>Reading.</i>) “Our representative will have much pleasure in calling
upon you this evening at seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. It’s gone seven now.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. They’re sending some one here to-night?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Yes, who will they send—either Trippett or the doctor. They are
both in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Then they may be here at any moment!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. But this is a simple matter now you’ve got the necessary money
coming in.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. But which one will they send, because it depends on that who
<i>you</i> are and who <i>I</i> am.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Well, I’ll get you to creep back and tell Pam that I withdraw my
claim—then, if the doctor calls you must get back in time to see him, and if Trippett
calls, I’ll see Trippett.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. But that won’t help <i>me</i> out—if they are going to sue
me—possibly for hundreds—I’m not going to lend you this money unless I can see a clean
sheet for myself—you got me into this mess, you must get me out of it! (<i>Sits</i>
<small>C</small>. <i>and groans.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. You <i>are</i> ungrateful. After all I’ve <i>done</i> for you. Are
you going to lend me the £500 or are you not?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Certainly. But I didn’t fall on top of this fat woman, and I’m
not going to be made to pay. You had the fun, you ought to suffer.</p>

<p class="direction_c">(J<small>OHN</small> <i>crosses to</i> <small>L</small>. <i>and

rung for Ursula.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Ursula!</p>

Ursula! (<i>In his best manner.</i>)</p>

<p>U<small>RSULA</small> (<i>abruptly</i>). Evening!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. We want you to do us a favour, if you will?</p>

<p>U<small>RSULA</small>. A favour?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. We want you to lend us some ladies’ clothes—just for an hour or
so.</p>

<p>U<small>RSULA</small>. What sort of clothes?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Oh, nothing—er—white—nothing under—underhand—just super
clothes—and if you do this, your master will be very much obliged to you and he’ll raise
your wages.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>rises and comes down</i> <small>C</small>.). John! What are
you going to do?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I think you will acknowledge this <i>is</i> an inspiration. These
’bus people think they are going to corner us, I can see <i>their</i> move. But you and I
are <i>far</i> too smart for them.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>in doubt</i>). Are we?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. It has only just struck me, <i>but you are the living image of the
fat old lady in the ’bus!</i></p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small> (<i>offended</i>). Oh! John!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Without the fat, of course. If you get into these clothes and pad
yourself all round, no one will know the difference.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. No, I couldn’t do that. It’s illegal!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I’m doing this to get <i>you</i> out of the pickle. I’m not doing
it for my own sake, please bear that in mind.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. But what good will it do?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. If the doctor or Trippett calls here, I shall say that I am Tully,
that is Tully’s brother, that I have had an interview with the lady in the ’bus accident
and she is strongly of opinion that the ’Bus Company is liable.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. But they’ll dispute it at once.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Naturally—then we are prepared. I shall just bring you into the
room dressed as the lady, with nothing to do but to bear out my statement.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. No, I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t do it! (<i>Turns</i>
<small>L</small>.)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Bertram! I have an idea—an idea that wouldn’t occur <i>to one man

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>takes clothes</i>). Thank you, Ursula, thank you. (<i>Gives
clothes to</i> T<small>ULLY</small>.) The very thing—but you’ll want a fearful lot of
padding—you’re so thin. (<i>He gathers up cushions from couch and arm-chair and pushes</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-83">[Pg 83]</a></span><i>them into</i>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. But, John, what about a bodice. I must have a bodice!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. What do you want a bodice for?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. For all this part. (<i>Pointing to chest.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. I’ll go and get a bodice off Ursula. Meanwhile you go into the
bedroom and get into these clothes as quickly as you can. Shave your top lip clean. Don’t
forget the cushions. Arrange them—diplomatically—you know—come out and go in—and all that

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>dances all round the room with joy, then over to</i>
P<small>AMELA</small>). There, there, dear, don’t go mad. It can’t be helped. We all make
mistakes.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Something must be done. This will kill mother.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. We must chance that.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>starting up</i>). Couldn’t Mr. Tully get the necklace back
for me?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. No, impossible!</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. Impossible, why?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small> (<i>takes</i> P<small>AMELA</small>’<small>S</small> <i>arm
confidentially</i>). I’ll tell you a secret, Pam, Tully’s a wrong ’un.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. A wrong ’un?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Yes, he’s a dark horse. And I’ll tell you something else. That
isn’t <i>Mrs.</i> Tully; that’s Tully’s little weakness. He calls her Agnes, and that’s
the type of man Mr. Tully is.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small> (<i>with a knowing nod of the head</i>). I had my suspicions.
Then perhaps there’s time for me to catch her before she finds the Rajah. (<i>She rushes
off windows</i> <small>R</small>.<small>C</small>.)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Come back, Pam. Come back!</p>

<p class="direction_c">(<i>Exit</i> P<small>AMELA</small>.)</p>

<p class="direction_c">(<i>Enter</i> A<small>UNT</small> H<small>ANNAH</small> <i>door</i>

<p>A<small>UNT</small> H<small>ANNAH</small>. Where is my nephew, sir? Where is my
nephew?</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Ah, Aunt Hannah! He’s afraid to meet you until you forgive me for
all I’ve done. There’s been a most absurd mistake caused by your likeness to Bertram. If
you’ll only let me explain.</p>

<p>A<small>UNT</small> H<small>ANNAH</small>. Really, I don’t think it matters.
(<i>Looking at her wet clothes.</i>)</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. But you’ve no idea what a wonderful likeness there is—except of
course—<i>you</i> look the younger.</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. John, it’s too late; the Rajah’s gone and taken the necklace
with him!</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. Thank heaven! And I’ll save up <i>your</i> money and buy you
another—and that’s the truth!</p>

<p>P<small>AMELA</small>. But you always <i>do</i> tell me the truth, John.</p>

<p>J<small>OHN</small>. But in future I’m going to tell you better truth. And now we can
go home in safety. (P<small>AMELA</small> <i>and</i> J<small>OHN</small> <i>going up to
window</i> <small>R</small>.<small>C</small>.) Oh, Bertram, where are you going?</p>

the Rajah. Will you take me out to supper?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. Certainly not!</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. Don’t be unkind.</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I couldn’t dream of such a thing.</p>

<p>M<small>AMIE</small>. Oh, Bertie, why not?</p>

<p>T<small>ULLY</small>. I’ve promised to take Auntie down to the Mission.</p>

<p>In general, this transcription attempts to retain the formatting, punctuation and
spelling of the source text. Some changes were made to correct for minor errors and
inconsistencies, especially in formatting or punctuation. The following changes were made
to the text:</p>

<ul>
<li>p. 5: Pamela. Must I remind you that—Changed “<i>Pamela</i>” to
“P<small>AMELA</small>” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 10: J<small>OHN</small> (<i>rising and crossing to Pamela</i>). Hang it all—Changed
“<i>Pamela</i>” to “P<small>AMELA</small>” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 18: “John stayed here, Kew.” (<i>Reading.</i>) John stayed here,
Bloomsbury.”—Inserted opening quotation mark before “John” after “(<i>Reading.</i>)”.</li>

<li>p. 24: (<i>Protests in action against the suggestion until John says</i>
“B<small>ERTRAM</small>,” <i>when a broad smile comes across his face.</i>)—Changed
“<i>John</i>” to “J<small>OHN</small>” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 30: M<small>AMIE</small> (<i>Very amused all the time</i>). Ripping, isn’t
it?—Changed “<i>Very</i>” to all lower case for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 33: M<small>AMIE</small> <i>assists him into arm-chair.</i> J<small>OHN</small>
<i>groaning all the time.</i>—Changed the period after “<i>arm-chair</i>” to a comma.</li>

<li>p. 33: Now then, Mr—<i>John</i> Ayers, isn’t it?—Inserted a period after “Mr” for
consistency.</li>

<li>p. 40: M<small>AMIE</small> (<i>turns her ring round to look like wedding ring and
holds hand up conspicuously</i>).—For consistency, reformatted this line as a stage
direction.</li>

<li>p. 42: Two weeks have elapsed since the events—Inserted an opening parenthesis for
consistency.</li>

<li>p. 45: T<small>ULLY</small>. No, John, you called last time—Inserted a period at the
end of the sentence.</li>

<li>p. 47: T<small>ULLY</small>. You haven’t give me a chance yet!—Changed “give” to
“given”.</li>

<li>p. 50: (P<small>AMELA</small> <i>rushes in dramatically, closing the door after
her.</i>) John! John! The doctor—the doctor.—For consistency and clarity, the stage
direction part of this line has been formatted on a line separate from the dialogue, and
the character title “P<small>AMELA</small>” has been inserted before “John! John!”</li>

<li>p. 54: D<small>OCTOR</small> (<i>picks up hat and follows her.</i>) Allow
<i>me.—</i>Moved the period after “<i>her</i>” to after the closing parenthesis for
consistency.</li>

<li>p. 58: why <i>her</i> husband is in <i>your</i> bedroom!”—Deleted quotation mark at
end of sentence.</li>

<li>p. 61: M<small>AMIE</small>. But I dare not go home without it. (<i>Throwing her arms
round</i> J<small>OHN</small>’<small>S</small> <i>neck</i>,) Darling, do please!—Changed
the comma after “<i>neck</i>” to a period.</li>

<li>p. 69: J<small>OHN</small> (<i>over to doctor</i>). Surely, you’re not going
to—Changed “<i>doctor</i>” to “D<small>OCTOR</small>” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 71: Do you think Mr Trippett—Inserted a period after “Mr” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 77: J<small>OHN</small> (<i>thinks. He has a brilliant idea. Takes out his penknife
and goes to wall at back, feels along wall</i>).—For clarity and consistency, this section
has been reformatted. The opening parentheses was moved to before “J<small>OHN</small>”
and whole stage direction has been formatted as a direction separate from dialogue.</li>

<li>p. 82: Thank you, Ursula, thank you—Inserted a period at the end of the sentence.</li>

<li>p. 95: <i>makes movement with arms as if swimming.</i>—Added a closing parenthesis
after “<i>swimming.</i>”</li>

<li>p. 96: Ha! Ha! I must give way (<i>still dancing.</i>)—Inserted a period after “way”
and capitalized “<i>still</i>”.</li>

<li>p. 101: The small table (J.) down <small>L</small>. in Act. I is moved to down
<small>C</small>.—Deleted the period after “Act”.</li>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
